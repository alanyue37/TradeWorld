RUNNING THE PROGRAM
A pre-made system with admins, users, and items can be found in the DemoTradeSystem in the package tradegateway and
can be run using DemoMain in the package trademain.

To run the program without anything premade, run the program from Main.java in package trademain. If you have already
run DemoMain before doing this, you must first delete serializedobjects.ser.

BEFORE RUNNING (IMPORTANT): Make sure File -> Project Structure -> Project compiler output ends in phase2/out
In File -> Project Structure -> Modules, add the java-json.jar and gson-2.8.6.jar files.
