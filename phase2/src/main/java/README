RUNNING THE PROGRAM
A pre-made system with admins, users, and items can be found in the DemoTradeSystem in the package tradegateway and
can be run using DemoMain in the package trademain. There are also a series of pre-made trades that have been commented
out.

To reset the program to the state given in DemoTradeSystem, the file serializedobjects.ser must be deleted. The initial
admin user that is able to add other admins to the system has username "ia" and password "initialize".

BEFORE RUNNING (IMPORTANT): Make sure File -> Project Structure -> Project compiler output ends in phase2/out
In File -> Project Structure -> Modules, add the java-json.jar and gson-2.8.6.jar files.
