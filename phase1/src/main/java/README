ADMINS
The initial Admin User that is able to add other admins to the system has username "ia" and password "initialize".
Once the the Admin User is logged in successfully, the Admin can make an account for other Admins (using their name,
choosing a unique username, and a password). The Admin User can freeze accounts and respond to Users that have requested
to unfreeze their accounts. The Admin reviews items to add to the system and the User's inventory. Additionally, the
admin can set a new lending threshold, set a new limit for transactions, set a new limit for incomplete transactions,
and view the current limit of edits and set a new limit for the edits.
