ADMIN
The initial Admin User that is able to add other admins to the system has username "ia" and password "initialize".
Once the the Admin User is logged in successfully, the Admin can make an account for other Admins (using their name,
choosing a username, and a password). The Admin User can freeze accounts and respond to Users that have requested to
unfreeze their accounts. The Admin reviews items to add to the system and the User's inventory. Additionally, the
admin can view the current lending threshold and set a new lending threshold, view the current transaction threshold and
set a new limit for transactions, view the current limit for having incomplete transaction and set a new limit
for incomplete transactions, view the current limit of edits and set a new limit for the edits.
