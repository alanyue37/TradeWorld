RUNNING THE PROGRAM
Run the program from Main.java in package trademisc.

ADMINS
The initial admin user that is able to add other admins to the system has username "ia" and password "initialize".
Once this user has logged in, there is an option to create additional admin users by specifying a name, username, and
password. The username must be unique to both all existing admin users and TradingUsers. Any subsequent admin users
that are created can then also create new admin users.


TRADING USERS
When the program is first run, there is an option to create a new account. This pertains to a new TradingUser and can
be instantiated with a provided name, username, and password. The username must be unique to both all existing admin
users and TradingUsers.


TRADES
A user can browse the system inventory and propose a trade by choosing the type of trade, items involved,
and meeting time.


ITEMS
To add an item to the system, a TradingUser must login and request to add an item to their inventory, which includes a
name and description. An admin user must then login and review recently added items to confirm that the item should
indeed be added.


OTHER SPECIFICATIONS
A pre-made system with admins, users, and items can be found in the DemoTradeSystem in the package tradegateway and
can be run using DemoMain in the package trademisc.

To run the program without anything premade, run the program from Main.java in package trademisc.

In line 29 of DataManager, there is a debug print statement for the filepath of the out package "tradegateway".
This filepath is obtained by loading the ClassLoader of the DataManager class, then getting the filepath of the package
folder.

After uncommenting this line, the first thing that should print is the filepath. It should end
.../group_0126/phase1/out/production/phase1/tradegateway

The location of the serialized objects folder is obtained by removing the last four path components
(to obtain .../group_0126/phase1) then appending /src/main/resources/ then the filename.
